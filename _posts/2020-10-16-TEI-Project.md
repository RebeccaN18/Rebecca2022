For our TEI coding project I was assigned the first column of page 655, the last page of "The Yellow Wallpaper" (insert hyperlink to OG text) and was instructed to use Oxygen XML Editor to turn my portion of the original text into a more easily readable online version that stayed true to the original’s formatting and content. I was very excited to work on a real Digital Humanities project, however, having done nothing similar to this in the past I was a little nervous when I first started out. Once I downloaded and started working with Oxygen however, I got a lot more comfortable very quickly. In the rest of this blog I will be detailing my experience with the program, the text I was transcribing into Oxygen, and the process that I went through in order to go from a PDF of the original text to a coded and formatted online version.

The first step in my project was working with our “TEI on Paper” exercise. The portion of text that I was responsible for had been copied from the PDF of the original and compiled into a Google Doc. From there I started the fairly simple process of commenting and marking up my text, making note of spoken quotes, em-dashes, paragraph beginnings, and italics. I didn’t have any images or other unique formatting to handle so the process was quick and easy. While it seemed pointless to mark up the document when it was short and you could easily see special characters and formatting it ended up being  helpful. Once we got to actually using Oxygen the comments made finding the portions of text that needed special attention and extra code easier and so this became a huge time saver. 
Once I actually opened the Oxygen editor and got ready to code I began to feel a lot more comfortable with the project. While the editor seems very intimidating it was very reminiscent of other coding programs and processors I had used in the past. In fact, with it’s color coded text, and it’s green and red indicator for if your code is functioning it was a lot more welcoming than most coding programs I’ve experienced. The layout of the editor and the easy to understand information it gives you in the bottom of the screen made checking the code very simple.

 The syntax was the only portion I struggled a bit with. It was very unique to Oxygen and while the basic language of coding was reminiscent of previous programs I had used, Oxygen is fairly fastidious about the code it runs. Copy and pasting is something I am used to doing in other coding programs, and Oxygen wasn’t able to run code that wasn’t manually typed into it or copied directly from within Oxygen. This led to some initial frustration as to why my code wasn’t valid even after meticulously checking the code for misspelled words or syntax errors. Once I identified the problem I was able to remedy it fairly quickly. While this process was fairly simple the fact that I didn’t have any major issues actually worried me quite a bit. I ended up contacting Dr. Stover to ensure my code wasn’t missing anything vital. Once I got a more expert opinion and some helpful comments on my work however, I was confident that I was doing the right thing. 
Looking back at this project as I wholeheartedly enjoyed the entire process. It was very informative and interesting to learn a new language of coding, as well as familiarizing myself with a new coding program. While I am by no means an expert at coding with Oxygen now I feel a lot more confident with the software as a whole. It’s now a program I would feel comfortable using for a future project or recommending it to another Digital Humanities or Computer Science student. Being an official part of a Digital Humanities project that is being worked on by qualified experts like my professor was a really rewarding experience. It helped me see what working in Digital Humanities has to offer, and got me excited to hopefully work on something like this again. I will definitely be checking back as the project nears its completion to see how it turns out in the end. I am so grateful for the opportunity to take part in this amazing project.
